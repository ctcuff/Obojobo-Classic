The examples in this module show you how to use MLA style (Modern Language Association) to cite sources; however,there are many other styles, so check with your instructor to find out which style is required. Other frequently used styles include: American Medical Association (AMA), American Psychological Association (APA), and the Chicago Manual of Style (CMS).

Copies of style manuals are available in the reference area of the library.</textformat>\r\r<textformat leftmargin='45' leading='5' rightmargin='45'>Citing sources is typically a two-step process. To cite sources using MLA style:\r\r<li><font color=\"#990000\"><b>Step 1</b></font> -- Create a <b>Works Cited</b> page, which should be included at the end of your paper, and list the required details about each source. Depending on the citation style you use, this page may be titled <b><i>References</i></b>, or <b><i>Bibliography</i></b>.</li>\r<li><font color='#990000'><b>Step 2</b></font> -- Add a <b>parenthetical citation</b> within the body of your paper wherever you include a quote or paraphrased or summarized text or ideas from an outside source.
