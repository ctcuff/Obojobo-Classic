Pro Account Quick Start Guide
=================================

About
=====

This guide is a supplement to the [Basic Account Quick Start Guide]([~46~]).  The Basic Account guide covers how to use objects from the public library, publish instances and collect scores.  This guide assumes that you are are familiar with these topics.

This guide is designed to provide an overview of the learning object creation process as well as how to manage the objects you create.

Pro Accounts
============

This guide is targeted towards users which have a Pro Account, and covers features and functionality that are only available for Pro Account users.  For more information on Basic and Pro accounts (and how to apply for a Pro Account), visit [this article]([~47~]).

What does Obojobo do with a Pro Account?
========================================

[Obojobo]([~8~]) is a management system to assist you in the creation and administration of [learning objects]([~13~]). With Obojobo, your students have access to purposeful and concise instructional pieces you design using the Obojobo editor.  As the author of learning objects, you are able to use the editor tools to build instructionally sound learning objects.  You can create these objects singularly or collaboratively with your colleagues with permission levels that you define.

What do I do as a Pro Account user?
===================================

As a pro account user you have the ability to author learning objects as well as manage and share them with your colleagues.  The Repository and Editor are the two interfaces you will use to create and manage your learning objects.


Creating objects
================

You can utilize the intuitive Obojobo editor tools to build your own learning objects.  These instructions cover the basics of how to begin constructing your own objects.  

**Note:** The remainder of this guide assumes that you are logged into Obojobo.  If you would like to follow along, log in and continue reading this guide.  For help on logging in, refer to the [FAQ on Logging In]([~16~]) or the [Login Help]([~43~]) page for more information.

1. Navigate to the 'My Objects' section in the Obojobo Repository.
1. Click on the purple 'Start New Draft' button in the upper-left corner.  <img style="display: block;" src="/assets/images/help/create/start-new-draft-button.png" />  This will bring up the editor interface.  The editor is divided into six primary sections which will guide through the process of creating your draft learning object.

<img src="/assets/images/help/create/creator-sections.png" />
<p style="font-size: 8pt; font-style: italic;">Six sections</p>
</div>

Each section in the editor is intended to do the following:
 
 1. **Overview**: to establish what your students are going to learn, i.e., set your learning objective. You have two options for writing learning objectives: 1) using the Objective Builder or 2) writing the learning objective without any assistance.
 1. **Content**: to organize all of the pages that make up the content of your object. You can arrange your text and media files by choosing from a set of page layouts.
 1. **Practice**: to organize interactive exercises, simulations and quizzes so that your students can practice what they learned in the content section.
 1. **Assessment**: to provide formal assessment as indicators of achieving mastery of the learning objective you set for your students. 
 1. **Metadata**: to define basic information about your object including language, description, some keywords and an estimated time to complete the learning object.
 1. **Finish**: to assist you in polishing up your object so that it is ready for distribution.


Drafts & Masters
================

Now is a good time to briefly cover some terminology.  In the Obojobo system, objects can come in two forms: Drafts & Masters.

When you start creating a new learning object, it starts life as a draft.  As the name implies, a draft is an incomplete object. As such, the only people that will see your draft is you and any collaborators you decide to add to your draft object. Students will never see your draft object.

In Obojobo, each draft learning object has a corresponding version number. Each new draft begins at version 0.1.  Each time you save, your draft's version number will increase - from 0.1 to 0.2, 0.2 to 0.3 and so on.

<img src="/assets/images/help/create/draft-process.png" />

In contrast to drafts, which are evolving works in progress, masters are polished, complete, and set in stone.  Masters are suitable to be viewed by students and used in courses.

Both drafts & masters are shown in the 'My Objects' section of the Repository.

For more information on the difference between a draft, master and an instance, read the [Drafts, Masters & Instances]([~23~]) article.


Saving objects
===============

<img src="/assets/images/help/create/creator-save-button.png" />

As you build your object, you should save your work by clicking on 'Save' in the lower right in the Obojobo editor.  Each time you save, the version number of your draft will increase (0.1 to 0.2, 0.2 to 0.3, and so on).


Editing objects
===============

The above information covers how to begin a brand new object.  However, eventually you will need to close your object and come back to it later.  In addition, other Obojobo users may grant you permissions to edit their objects.  In both of these cases, you will be editing an existing object.  To do so,

1. In the Repository, navigate to the 'My Objects' tab.
2. Select the desired saved draft from the listing on the left-hand side.
3. Click on the purple 'Continue Editing' button.  This will launch the editor interface, allowing you to continue working where you left off.

While constructing your object, refer to these guides for helpful information on best practices:

* [Content]([~22~])
* [Text Guidelines]([~31~])
* [Media Assets]([~25~])
* [Practice]([~27~])

Previewing objects
==================
There are two methods of previewing the objects that you have created.  If you are in the Obojobo Repository, you can preview any object by selecting the object in the 'My Objects' section and clicking the purple 'Preview' button.

<img src="/assets/images/help/create/my-objects-preview-button.png" />

Alternatively, if you are actively editing an Object using the editor, you can use the 'Preview Student View' button in the lower right-hand corner.  

<img src="/assets/images/help/create/preview-student-view-button.png" />

Both of these buttons will open the object in the Obojobo Viewer in preview mode, which is how your students will interact with your object.


The Final Step
===============
As you continue to edit your object you will move closer and closer to completion.  When you have finished creating your object, you will need to finalize your object from a draft into a master.

When you are ready to finalize your object, navigate to the "Finish" section in the Obojobo editor.  This will open up the 'Master Checklist'.  The Master Checklist will list any problems found in your object, such as a question missing answer text or a blank content page.  You will need to go through the checklist and resolve these issues before your draft object can be finalized.  This step is required to ensure that all objects created in Obojobo are complete.

<div style="margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;">
<img src="/assets/images/help/create/master-checklist.png" />
<p style="font-size: 8pt; font-style: italic;">Master Checklist</p>
</div>

**Note:** Before continuing, please be aware that you cannot directly edit master objects.  If you finalize your draft object into a master, you will need to create a new master if you decide to make changes.  Therefore, please review your object making sure you are satisfied with your object before finalizing your object.

After completing the items in the Master Checklist, click on the 'Create Master...' button at the top of the checklist pane.

<img src="/assets/images/help/create/create-master-button.png" />

This will bring up a dialog asking you to confirm.  Click on the blue button to complete the procedure.

<img src="/assets/images/help/create/create-master-window.png" />

Afterwards, dismiss the success dialog to close the editor and return to the Repository, where your newly created Master object will be automatically selected.

<img src="/assets/images/help/create/master-success-window.png" />

Deployment: Publishing instances
================================

Publishing instances from your objects is very similar to publishing instances from the Public Library (which is described in detail in the [Basic Account Quick Start Guide]([~46~])).  Simply select your Master object from within the 'My Objects' section, then click on the purple 'Publish Instance' button.

**Note:** You can publish instances from Master objects, but you cannot publish instances from Drafts.  If you don't see the 'Publish Instance' button then you have selected a Draft object instead of a Master.  Since Drafts are works in progress they are not complete and are not ready to be seen by students.

Viewing & Downloading Scores
============================

Viewing & Downloading Scores is covered in depth in the [Basic Account Quick Start Guide]([~46~]).

Continuing development
======================

Once created, your master objects will remain intact.  However, you may want to improve or modify your objects.  This is possible by creating a new draft series from a master object.

To do this,

1. Navigate to the 'My Objects' section of the Repository.
2. Select the master object you wish to modify.
3. Click on the purple 'Edit as New Draft' button.

This will pull up the editor, allowing you to begin working on a new version of your master object.  When you finalize your new draft object, it will become the next version (2.0, 3.0, etc) of your object.  Note that creating a new version of your master object doesn't remove the older versions.  Your 2.0 object can co-exist with version 1.0.  Should you decide to remove one master object, the other master versions will remain intact.  In addition, if you decide to delete a draft, any related masters will not be deleted.

Refer to [Drafts, Masters & Instances]([~23~]) for more information on this topic.
