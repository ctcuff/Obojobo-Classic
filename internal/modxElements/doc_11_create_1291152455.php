Content Creation
================
Creation of learning object content in Obojobo comes with certain responsibilities and requirements. Not every user gets the privilege to be a content creator, so those of you who do should feel a little special.

We encourage the creation of learning objects rich with instructional value that cleverly utilizes media to help students achieve the desired learning objective. To do so, Obojobo provides a basic editing tool as well as the ability to incorporate media such as images and interactive media saved as Flash files.

Who is a content creator
========================
At UCF, our faculty and staff automatically gain content creation status. You could use Obojobo to create engaging teaching and training with opportunities to assess learning and to enhance your web courses, staff training, and maybe a few other purposes we haven't thought of yet. If you are not a UCF employee (maybe you are a student) and need access to create content, you need to send us a request to be able to create content.

Your role as a content creator
==============================
Content creators have rights to contribute content to our entire Obojobo community; with this capability comes great responsibility. We ask that you contribute by creating clean, concise, and rich content. Optimize your content and be mindful about message design, graphic design, file sizes, and learner interaction. We are trying our best to make you look great, and we are happy when you return the favor.
