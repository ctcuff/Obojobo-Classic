Accounts
========

* **How do I get an account?** - By default, all UCF affiliates that have access to [myUCF](http://my.ucf.edu) will have Obojobo accounts.
* **What is my login group?** - View [Login Help]([~43~]) for more information.
* **What is my username?** - If you are a UCF student, faculty, staff, or affiliate, your username is your NID.
* **What is my NID?** - You can determine your NID [here](https://my.ucf.edu/static_support/pidnidwrapper.html).  For more information on NIDs, click [here](http://www.registrar.sdes.ucf.edu/weg/pid_nid/what_are/).
* **What is my password?** - Your password is your UCF NID Password, which will be the same password you use for Webcourses.
* **I can't login!** - Your NID password is probably expired.  Visit the NID Password reset page [here](https://www.secure.net.ucf.edu/extranet/reset/validation.aspx?type=nid) to reset your password.  This should fix 99% of login problems.
* **I can login to Webcourses, but not Obojobo** - The passwords for these systems are out of sync.  Reset your password [here](https://www.secure.net.ucf.edu/extranet/reset/validation.aspx?type=nid) which will reset the password for both systems.
* **I don't have a UCF Card Number** - If you are a guest without a UCF ID Card will need to call the Service Desk (407-823-5117) to reset your password.
