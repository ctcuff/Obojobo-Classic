<ul>
	<li><h3>What's Happening?</h3>
		<p>Obojobo is undergoing several updates.  Some hardware, some infrastructure, and some feature additions.  We apologize for the inconvenience, but at least we promise to return with presents from our adventures.</p>
	</li>
	<li><h3>When Will It Be Back?</h3>
		<p>Obojobo will be back online at the end of Monday Aug 16th.  Right now we're looking at 4pm, but we'll keep this notice updated as the upgrades procede.  </p>
	</li>

	<li><h3>When Will It Happen Again?</h3>
		<p>Obojobo and <a href="http://kogneato.ucf.edu">Kogneato</a> are now on a regular update schedule.  These updates will occur after grades are due at the end of each semester.</p>
	</li>

	<li><h3>Stay Updated</h3>
		<p>For up to the minute status information, check Obojobo's <a href="http://twitter.com/Obojobo">Twitter account</a>.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Some New Features.</h2>

<ul>
	<li><h3>Free Form Page Layouts</h3>
		<p>Obojobo has always had easy to use layouts, but several of our uses wanted the freedom to build something more complex.  We now have a custom layout tool that will allow you to place text or media in just about any possible orientation.  You can overlap items, scale them, change borders, background colors; all while the page stays consistent at any viewing size.</p>
	</li>
	<li><h3>Kogneato Integration</h3>
		<p>For the first time, Kogneato can now be embedded inside Obojobo. We're talking content, practice, and even assessment. If your Kogneato widget scores, it will automatically pass scores to Obojobo. Not only do the scores integrate seamlessly, but so do the student's accounts. UCF students and staff will be automagically logged in to Kogneato right there inside Obojobo. We put a lot of effort into bridging the gap between these tools, we think you find it indispensable.</p>
	</li>
	<li><h3>Clean / Short URLs</h3>
		<p>We cleaned up our urls to make them a little neater, easier on the eyes, and your keyboard.  Learning objects will now look something like this: https://obojobo.ucf.edu/view/10.  Gone are all the gnarly variables, question marks, and ampersands.</p>
	</li>
	<li><h3>Much More</h3>
		<p>There are a bunch of changes under the hood that you won't see right away. We've upgraded just about every piece of software we rely on, from our server to our CMS. We've been laying the ground work for score integration with WebCourses@UCF, and we have quite a few new features on the way. The future is bright, and we're constantly dreaming up new and better ways to help you shape the future of learning on line.</p>
