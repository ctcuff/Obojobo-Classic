Basic Account Quick Start Guide
=================================

About
=====

This guide is designed to get you started using the Obojobo system in your course or program.

What does Obojobo do?
=====================

[Obojobo]([~8~]) is a management system created to assist you in utilizing [learning objects]([~13~]) in your course or institutional programs.  With Obojobo, your students have access to purposeful and concise instructional pieces built using the Obojobo editor.  These objects include content, practice and a scored assessment, all tied together by a learning objective built with instructional design principals.  Each object created in Obojobo has a consistent interface, meaning that it only takes one object to become familiar with the interface.  Each object you assign includes scored assessment which Obojobo collects and reports automatically.  In addition, visualization tools allow you to dig deeper and see exactly how students interacted with the objects you assign.

For more information on the Obojobo system, read [About Obojobo]([~8~]) or [Obojobo Features]([~6~]).

What are Learning Objects?
==========================

Refer to [this]([~13~]) article for information on learning objects.

What do I do?
=============

Your interaction with Obojobo will be through the **[Obojobo Repository](/repository)**.  You can access the Repository from a link on the front page of this site.  When opening this link, you will be presented with the Login screen.  Continue reading for instructions on logging in.

Technical Requirements
======================

You and your students will need a modern browser and an up-to-date version of the Adobe Flash plug-in.  View the [Software Requirements page]([~17~]) for the most up-to-date requirements.  

**Note:** A [Student Quick Start Guide]([~19~]) is available which can help explain the technical requirements to students.  Distributing this resource is covered later on in this guide (inside the 'Example Posting' section). 

Downtime & Updates
==================

Obojobo uses Twitter to handle status updates such as when upgrades are made to the system or when expected server outages will occur.  These updates are shown in the Repository and through the Viewer interface at the bottom of log-in screen, when you or a student first visits Obojobo.  

<div style="margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;">
<img src="/assets/images/help/create/system-status.png" />
<p style="font-size: 8pt; font-style: italic;">System Updates appear at the bottom of the Repository & Viewer login pages</p>
</div>

In addition, Twitter users can friend [our twitter account](http://www.twitter.com/obojobo/) to be informed of these changes.  Alternately, you can use an RSS reader to subscribe to [our Twitter RSS feed](http://twitter.com/statuses/user_timeline/14709413.rss).  Our account and RSS feed links are also provided on the [front page](/) of our site.


Logging-in
==========

If you are a faculty or staff member at UCF you should already have access to Obojobo.  You will need to provide your UCF NID and NID Password to gain access.  To login,

1. Open the Repository by clicking the link on the front of the Obojobo website (or, [click here](/repository))
1. If you are not already logged in, you will be asked to choose your login group.  Click on 'UCF User Login'.
1. Provide your UCF NID and NID Password.

If you are having issues logging in, the probable cause is that you need to reset your NID Password.  Visit the [NID Password Reset Page](https://www.secure.net.ucf.edu/extranet/reset/validation.aspx?type=nid) to do this.  For more help logging in, visit the [FAQ on Logging In]([~16~]) or the [Login Help]([~43~]) page.

The rest of this guide assumes that you are logged into the Repository.  If you are following along, go ahead and login before reading the rest of this guide.

Browsing Objects
================

In order to use learning objects in your course, you first need to find some objects that you would like to use.  To do so,

1. In the Repository, navigate to the 'Public Library' section.  The Public Library contains objects that other users have contributed.  These objects are open for all users of Obojobo to use.
<img src="/assets/images/help/create/repo-library-section.png" />
1. Select an object from the listing on the left-hand side.  This is a list of all of the objects in the Public Library. <img style="display: block;" src="/assets/images/help/create/public-library-listing.png" />
1. The interface will update, showing details about the object you have selected.  Among these details, the most important piece of information is the learning objective.  The learning objective describes what the object aims to teach and assess.

Previewing Objects
==================

<img src="/assets/images/help/create/library-preview-button.png" />

In the 'Public Library' section you can preview an object to see what a student will see.  To do so, select an object in the Public Library, then click on the purple 'Preview' button.  This will open the object in the Obojobo Viewer interface in a new window.  You can simply close this window to return to the Repository.

<div style="margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;">

<p style="font-size: 8pt; font-style: italic;">The Obojobo Viewer</p>
</div>

Distribution
============

Once you have found an object or objects you would like to use, you will need to publish an instance to utilize it in your course.

Instances
---------

In Obojobo terms, an *instance* is a special type of object that essentially is a copy of a master learning object, much like a compact disc or vinyl record is a copy that was pressed from an original master recording.  The objects listed in the Public Library are like the Master recordings - these are the pristine originals that are not to be used directly.  Instances, on the other hand, are packaged and ready to be used & distributed.

<img src="/assets/images/help/create/master-recording-and-pub-instance.png" />

Publishing Instances
--------------------

Creating an instance is referred to as 'Publishing an Instance'.  Why is this step required?  Instances are what students will access, which means that the assessment scores collected will be connected to that instance.  Since you wouldn't want scores from multiple classes or programs to be lumped together into the same instance, instances created in the Obojobo system are targeted for one specific use.  In other words, from one master object you can create multiple different instances - one for each course, section, semester, program, etc.

In addition to recording scores, instances have some options which you set when you publish an instance.  These include a name, a time period for when a student can access the instance and when the assessment is available, the number of assessment attempts available to students, and the way in which Obojobo will calculate the final score.

<div style="margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;">
<img src="/assets/images/help/create/about-instances.png" />
<p style="font-size: 8pt; font-style: italic;">Each instance contains its own scores and options</p>
</div>

These are options that are provided to help you best utilize the object in a way that meets your demands and integrates with your course/syllabus.  Note that these options describe one specific instance, so each instance you create can have different settings.

To publish an instance,

1. Navigate to the 'Public Library' section in the Repository
1. Select an object from the Public Library.
1. Click on the purple 'Publish Instance' button.  <img src="/assets/images/help/create/library-pub-inst-button.png" />

This will bring up the Publish Instance dialog (shown below), prompting you to define the options for this instance.  Complete all fields, noting the help presented on the right-hand side of the dialog window which will guide you through the process.  When finished, press the blue 'Publish' button.

<img src="/assets/images/help/create/pub-inst-window.png" />

You should now be presented with the 'Distribute Instance' window, providing you with the instance link.

<img src="/assets/images/help/create/instance-distribute-window.png" />

This important link is what you will provide to students in order for them to access your instance.  If you close this window, note that this link (along with all of the information you entered when creating the instance) is kept in the instance record.

To view an instance record,

1. Navigate to the 'Published Instances' section in the Repository.  This section contains every instance you have published.
<img src="/assets/images/help/create/repo-pub-instances-section.png" />
1. Select the instance from the listing on the left-hand side.  The interface will update to display the information about this instance. 

From here, you can click on the 'Distribute' button to reopen the 'Distribute Instance' window.
<img src="/assets/images/help/create/instance-distribute-button.png" />

Example Posting
---------------

It would be useful to provide some user friendly information to go along with the link you plan on distributing to your students.  Below is an example posting which could be sent via e-mail or posted in a Webcourses module.  You are welcome to modify this example as you see fit.

**HTML Version:**

<pre>
Your instructor has assigned you a learning object via UCF's Obojobo system.
To access this object, visit this link: [PASTE INSTANCE URL HERE]

For more information on the link given to you or on the Obojobo system, click &lt;a href=&quot;https://obojobo.ucf.edu/help/view/Student-Quick-Start-Guide.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to visit the brief Student Quick Start Guide.
</pre>

**Text Version:**
<pre>
Your instructor has assigned you a learning object via UCF's Obojobo system.
To access this object, visit this link: [PASTE INSTANCE URL HERE]

For more information on the link given to you or on the Obojobo system, visit https://obojobo.ucf.edu/help/view/Student-Quick-Start-Guide.html to read the brief Student Quick Start Guide.
</pre>

**Note:** The example posting above provides a link to the [Student Quick Start Guide]([~19~]).  This is a useful resource which you can provide students to better orient them with the Obojobo system, cover concepts they need to understand and explain technical requirements.  It is recommended that you look at this document to see if it may be useful to provide to your students.

Editing Details
---------------

<img src="/assets/images/help/create/edit-inst-details.png" />

Once you create your instance it is saved along with all of the options you defined when you first created it.  If you wish to change these options (for example, increase the number of assessment attempts or change the assessment due date), click on the purple 'Edit Details' button in the 'Instance Details' tab in the 'Published Instances' section.  This will bring up the Edit Details dialog window which will have the same fields as the window used to create your instance.  Edit the values, then click on the blue 'Save' button to commit the changes.  The interface should update, showing you the new details for the instance selected.

Scores
======

Viewing Scores
--------------

After you have assigned your instance or instances, students should begin completing assessment attempts.  Obojobo collects these scores automatically.  At any time you may review the scores collected so far.  To do so,

1. Navigate to the 'Published Instances' section of the Repository.
1. Select the Instance for which you want to view the assessment scores.
1. Click on the 'Assessment Scores' tab at the top of the Published Instances section.

<img src="/assets/images/help/create/assessment-scores-tab.png" />

This will bring up the Assessment Scores pane which features all student scores recorded thus far.  Also included is a frequency distribution chart which allows you to see how performance at a glance.

Downloading Scores
------------------

You can download scores into a CSV file for importing into other applications.  To do so, click on the purple 'Download Scores' button above the student score listing.

<img src="/assets/images/help/create/download-scores.png" />

This CSV file can be imported into your Webcourses gradebook.  Read [Importing Obojobo Scores into Webcourses]([~52~]) for a step-by-step tutorial on how to do this.

Viewing Score Details
---------------------

The Assessment Scores pane gives you final scores only, however, the Score Details feature allows you to dig deeper to see responses, question scores and attempt scores for a user.  Clicking on the 'Details' button beside the final score will open the Score Details dialog.

<img src="/assets/images/help/create/visit-viewer-button.png" />

Refer to [Score Details]([~57~]) for full documentation for this feature.

Incomplete Assessments
----------------------

When students take an assessment attempt, they are required to submit it when they are done answering questions.  Occasionally, a student forgets to actually submit the assessment attempt.  Unsubmitted assessments do not impact the final score, however, you can use the 'Score Details' feature to see assessments in progress or assessments that were never submitted.

Visit Visualizer
---------------

<img src="/assets/images/help/create/open-visit-viewer.png" />

The Visit Visualizer tool allows you to see how a student progressed through an instance, visit by visit and page by page.  You can launch the visit visualizer from the Score Details window.

<div style="margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;">
<img src="/assets/images/help/create/visit-viewer.png" />
<p style="font-size: 8pt; font-style: italic;">The Visit Visualizer</p>
</div>

Viewing Scores By Question
--------------------------

The Scores By Question is a powerful feature that allows you to see every recored response for every question in the instance.  You can launch the Scores By Question feature by clicking on the purple button above the student score listing.

<img src="/assets/images/help/create/view-scores-by-question.png" />

<img src="/assets/images/help/create/score-by-question-graph.png" />

This feature can be useful to see which questions students had the most difficulty with and how they responded.  The overview tab lets you see a graph of which answers were more commonly chosen, while the student responses tab provides a list of each recorded response.

Additional Attempts
-------------------

You may be in a situation where you would like to grant additional assessment attempts for one or more users, but not for all users.  For example, a student may complain that they submitted an assessment attempt accidentally and would like to take the assessment again.  By granting this student an additional attempt, they can receive another chance.  To do this, navigate to the 'Assessment Scores' tab for the instance you are interested in, then click the 'Edit' button which will bring up an input control.  Use the input control to define how many additional attempts you would like to grant, then click 'Apply' to commit the operation.

<img src="/assets/images/help/create/additional-attempts.png" />

The total number of assessment attempts available to a student is the sum of the number of attempts for that instance plus the number of additional attempts that you have granted.

**Note:** If you would like to grant additional attempts to all users, instead use the 'Edit Details' feature to simply change the number of assessment attempts available for the instance.  See the 'Editing Details' section discussed earlier in this guide.

Advanced Features
=================

Sharing Instances
-----------------
The Instance Managers feature allows you to share control to your instance.  This also includes the ability for other users to view scoring data.  To add Instance Managers to your instance, select an instance and click on 'Managers'.

<img src="/assets/images/help/create/instance-managers-button.png" />

Creating Derivative Works
-------------------------
Some objects in the Public Library grant you the option to make minor modifications to them by producing a derivative work.  Read [Creating Derivative Works]([~48~]) for more information.

Authoring Content
-----------------
Pro account users have the additional ability to author their own learning objects.  If you would like to author your own content, sign up for a pro account by visiting [this form]([~42~]).  Read [Basic & Pro Accounts]([~47~]) for more information on these two different account types.
