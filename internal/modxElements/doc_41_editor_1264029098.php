Editor
======
The Obojobo Editor allows you to build and edit learning objects.  The editor will launch whenever you click on 'Start a new draft' or 'Continue editing' from the repository.

Interface
=========
The Editor interface is composed of five parts as shown below:

<img class="mediacenter" src="/assets/images/help/create/editor-interface.png" width="500"  alt="" />


At the top, you will find the section bar in which each button represents a section of the editor that walks you through the process of creating a learning object. The seven major sections in the editor are: 1) Metadata, 2) Objective, 3) Content, 4) Practice, 5) Assessment, 6) Keywords, and 7) Finalize.

Second (down the editor interface), you will see the learning objective bar which displays your learning objective, serving as a reminder while you build your object.

The third section is the help area which explains the purpose behind each section.

The fourth section is the main work area where you create, edit, and set your learning object. The interface in this area will differ depending on the section you work on when creating/editing an object.

Lastly, you will find the control bar which contains the 'Save' button to save your object, the 'Close' button to close the editor, and the 'View Wiki Help' button to open in-depth documentation on Obojobo and the creation of learning objects.

Help
======
The Obojobo help section has three different states.

* In its closed state, the help is hidden with the exception of a small help button.

<img class="mediacenter" src="/assets/images/help/create/editor-help-mini.png" alt="" />

* Clicking on the minimized help button will expand the help to the Guidelines state.  In this expanded state, the system cycles through guiding principles that will provide you with recommended practices and strategies in designing your objects.

<img class="mediacenter" src="/assets/images/help/create/editor-help-guidelines.png" width="500"  alt="" />

* While in the Guidelines state, click 'Read more help...' to expand the help further and obtain in-depth information.  At this state, the help takes over the entire content area to share with you helpful information about each section, and to understand the purpose of the section.  

You can reduce the help to the Guidelines state by clicking 'See Less...' and completely minimize the help by clicking on the 'X' in the upper right.

Locking
=======
Whenever you edit a learning object, that object becomes locked.  If any of your collaborators attempts to edit the object while it is locked, the collaborator will be denied access.  Similarly, you will not be allowed to edit an object that a collaborator is editing.  The object will unlock when you close the object.

This locking mechanism prevents multiple users from overwriting each other's work.
